This is some code I put together for a program evaluation project for a client. 

I was modeling political candidate behavior, but was frustrated by the lack of off-the-shelf covariates at the district-level, so I created some economic, demographic, and partisan control variables by overlapping county- and precinct-level data with legislative district shape files (congressional and state upper and lower).

If you're having trouble finding the underlying data (there is code to fetch them from the relevant government agencies), shoot me an email at hansinge.lango[at]gmail.com.
